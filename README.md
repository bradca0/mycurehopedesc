While medical information is widely accessible, most of it is highly decentralized. As a result, many patients are unable to make educated choices and are influenced by less reliable information sources, especially given the rise of social media.

These outcomes are devastating. In the past 20 years, medication errors have ballooned by 300 percent. At MyCureHope, we believe that the decisions patients make about your health are one of the most important things patients will make about their life. Consequently, patients have a moral right to understand such important decisions.

This website is meant for its users to have a database they can constantly count on. MyCureHope has collected information about over 35,000+ treatments, 30,000+ doctors, 2,000+ hospitals, 1,500+ protocols, and 100 charities. Let's empower our decisions together!
